# Student Manager CLI

A simple Python command‑line application to manage student records.  
This project was built **module by module (function by function)** to demonstrate clean design, file handling, and basic data persistence.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new students with name, age, and marks
- View all students in a formatted list
- Show the total number of students
- Remove a student by name
- Search for a student
- Calculate the average age of all students
- Save student data to a JSON file
- Load student data from a JSON file
- Quit the application gracefully

## 📂 Project Structure
- `student_manager.py` → main CLI script
- `students.json` → JSON file used for saving/loading data
- Functions are modular (e.g., `add_student()`, `remove_student()`, `save_data()`, `load_data()`)
